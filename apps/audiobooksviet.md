# Privacy Policy for AudiobooksViet App
This Privacy Policy is established by ohralathe for the mobile application AudiobooksViet (the "App").

## 1. Data Collection and Usage
AudiobooksViet is committed to protecting user privacy while providing a high-quality listening experience. To achieve this, we collect two types of information:

- Non-Personally Identifiable Information (Non-PII): We do not collect your name, email address, phone number, or physical address.

- Technical and Usage Data: We collect technical information related to your device and how you interact with the App (e.g., app launches, screen views, and button clicks). This data is used solely to analyze app performance and improve user experience.

- Local Data: Usage state data such as listening history, playback positions, and bookmarks are stored locally on your device. This data is removed when you uninstall the application.

## 2. Third-Party Services
To ensure app stability and optimize features, we integrate services from Google Firebase. These services may collect certain information automatically:

- **Firebase Analytics**: Collects data such as your device model, operating system version, and unique identifiers (like the Android Advertising ID). This helps us understand which audiobooks are popular and how the app is being used.

- **Firebase Crashlytics**: In the event of an app crash, technical logs (stack traces) and device state information are sent to Google to help us identify and fix bugs quickly.

For more information on how Google handles this data, please visit: How Google uses information from sites or apps that use our services.

## 3. Data Security and Retention
We prioritize the security of the data we handle:

- Technical data processed by Firebase is encrypted in transit.

- Since we do not host a central user database for personal information, there is no risk of personal identity leakage from our side.

- Analytics data is typically retained by Google Firebase according to their standard retention policies (usually 14 months).

## 4. Your Rights and Choices
You can opt-out of certain data collection features:

- Advertising ID: You can reset or disable your Advertising ID through your Android device settings (Settings > Google > Ads).

- App Permissions: You can manage or revoke permissions granted to the App at any time through your device settings.

## 5. Future Updates (Login Features)
If we introduce features such as Google SSO (Single Sign-On) in the future to synchronize your listening history across devices, we will update this Policy to describe the specific data provided by Google and how it is used.

## 6. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Effective Date" below.
